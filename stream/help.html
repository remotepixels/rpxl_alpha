        The streaming page is only for desktop browsers, however streams can be viewed on most desktop and mobile devices using the chrome browser.    </p>
    <p>
        This application can only create streams from sources available to your browser, such as a webcam, display capture device, or a virtual camera source such as NDI or OBS Virtual camera.    </p>
    <p>
        You must allow your browser to access your webcam and microphone to use this application, see your browser settings if you are prompted.    </p>

        <p class="pointItem">
            You are limited to 6 Alpha numeric characters, avoid using simple or easily guessable IDs to prevent unwanted guests joining (such as ABCDEF or 123456).

    <h1>Misc</h1>
    <p>
        Not having a central server introduces some benefits and some gotcha's that bear thinking about when using the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        As all Guests are connecting directly to your machine and not a central server we recommend using wired ethernet. Wifi has inherit latency issues which will disrupt the stream.
        If you are having issues with sync or dropped frames try this first.
        Your host PC must be able to encode and transmit the video in real time while you are working (although this can be offloaded to another machine), a modern CPU & GPU is essential.
        This app has been tested on modern Macs and although RAM is not an issue the more cores, the better.
    <p>
        Every extra guest that connects will increase the load on the hosts workstation, with a modern system and GPU, rooms of about a dozen people should be doable.
        Guests connect at a very low resolution and very little bandwidth, typically under 80kbps per user, the majority of your bandwidth is prioritised to the main stream.
        Guests are also connected directly peer to peer to one another so you do not need to process their audio or video locally to retransmit.
